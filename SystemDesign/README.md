# Frontend System Design & Interview Notes

This folder is for documenting frontend system design learning, interview experiences, design solutions, and code snippets. It will help you prepare for system design interviews (e.g., designing a trading dashboard) and keep track of real interview questions and your solutions.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Common system design questions (e.g., trading dashboard, real-time data display, permission management)
- Architecture design approaches (component decomposition, state management, performance optimization, scalability)
- Technology choices and reasoning (React/Vue, Redux/MobX, WebSocket, TypeScript, etc.)
- Real interview questions and your answers
- Design diagrams, flowcharts, pseudocode
- Common pitfalls and best practices
